A axum server app to test and learn features on

## Notes 

The commits are made in such a way as to demonstrate and try one feature or workflow (refactoring) at a time.  
So the git log could be educative.  

You can also look at a blog post with some personal notes (mostly for the Rust side) here : [running-notes-on-rust-and-axum-framework]
